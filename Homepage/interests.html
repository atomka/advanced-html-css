	  		The Met West Garden was started in the Fall of 2011 on abandoned ground that was ceded by the City of Chicago when they dismantled an old north south line that ran just west of Ashland Ave 40 years ago.

	  		I started brewing in the winter of 2011 and I have found it to be a rewarding if not difficult experience. Who knew high school chemestry was so important to drinking. If I had a time machine that class might be the second place that I would stop at right after telling Lincoln to duck.

	  		Biking in the City of Chicago is just as challanging as it is rewarding. Helping drive the city towards a more bike friendly infrastructure is something that I volunteer my time and that is why I helped start the 1st Ward Transportation Advisory Council.
