	  		Hello and welcome to my home page. I imagine that you are here for one of two reasons. The first possiblity is that one of my enemies has scrawlled my name on the bathroom wall of a pancake house located 30 miles from a minimum security prison in rural S.E. Colorado. If that is the case well played Dan Jekic. The second possiblity is that you have come in peace and are interested in learing more about what I've done and what I'm continuing to work on.

		  <p>Growing up in my family a lot of emphisis was put on the quality and care that goes into creating a great meal and warm experience around the table. I have translated that experience and understanding to brewing.

		  <p>As I've made my journey from west to east across the midwest it was important that I did not forget my origins. In the West Town Community I helped create the Met West Community Garden. My 3 x 11 plot of dirt is my tie to the land from which I came.
